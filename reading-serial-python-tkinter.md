Few days ago I wanted to read the serial port using Python and Tkinter under GNU/Linux, I found this great site:

[https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-temperature-and-humidity-sensor/python-interface](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluetooth-temperature-and-humidity-sensor/python-interface){:target="_blank"}

It works with python, pyserial and Tkinter but I only found a little problem: it works with python-2
So I've updated this code and I get this one to works with python-3

You can see the complete code here.
